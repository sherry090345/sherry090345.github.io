I am currently a Research Data Coordinator at the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research. I completed my Master of Health Science in Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2023 and received my Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Biology from Northwest A&F University in China in 2021. My research focuses on cardiovascular epidemiology, particularly biomarker discovery, coronary artery calcium imaging, and proteomic profiling to improve risk prediction and clinical care in aging populations.
