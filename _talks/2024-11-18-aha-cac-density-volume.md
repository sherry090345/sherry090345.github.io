**Presenter:** Hairong Liu  
**Co-authors:** Y. Mok, et al.  
**Study Focus:** This study evaluated both density and volume of coronary calcification as complementary imaging biomarkers. Findings confirmed their independent associations with cardiovascular events in older adults.

Key Highlights:
- Used spline-based models and competing risk analysis
- Showed additive predictive value of density and volume
- Highlights clinical importance of advanced CAC phenotyping
