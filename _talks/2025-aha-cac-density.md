**Presenter:** Hairong Liu  
**Co-authors:** Y. Mok, et al.  
**Study Focus:** This poster presented findings from the ARIC Study showing that coronary calcium density metrics significantly improve cardiovascular risk prediction in older adults beyond the traditional Agatston score. The analysis demonstrates improved discrimination and reclassification, supporting the use of advanced imaging biomarkers in risk stratification of the elderly population.

Key Highlights:
- Used spline-based models and machine learning for imaging-derived biomarkers  
- Demonstrated additive predictive value of calcium density  
- Highlights implications for personalized prevention strategies in aging populations
