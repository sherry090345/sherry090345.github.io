**Presenter:** Hairong Liu  
**Co-authors:** J. Ishigami, L. Mathews, et al.  
**Study Focus:** This analysis showed that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is independently associated with heart failure risk in a community-based population, suggesting its utility as a biomarker for early detection.

Key Highlights:
- Used Cox proportional hazards models with multivariable adjustment
- Demonstrated dose-response association
- Proposed BUN as a low-cost clinical marker
