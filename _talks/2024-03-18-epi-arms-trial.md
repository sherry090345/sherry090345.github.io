**Presenter:** Hairong Liu  
**Co-authors:** A. Sabit, D. Zhao, et al.  
**Study Focus:** This randomized crossover trial demonstrated how incorrect arm positioning can lead to significant overestimation of blood pressure readings. Results provide practical guidance for improving clinical accuracy.

Key Highlights:
- First randomized trial to isolate positioning effect
- Demonstrated up to 7–10 mmHg error from unsupported positions
- Supports updated clinical measurement guidelines
